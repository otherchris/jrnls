PROGRAMS ARE MADE OF DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS

## The high level design phase

No thought of code, infrastructure, or any particular technology whatsoever. Realm of pure thought.

### Find all the data
  - datastorm: list every piece of information relevant to your domain

### Find everything that happens
  - eventstorm: list all the events

### Find the causality
  - put events in order

### Add the data
  - label the events with their data dependencies

### Find the aggregates
  - look for "fellow travelers" in the data labels. What pieces of data are together a lot of the
    time?


##
## The Type Module

### Steps
- find all the state in your domain
- create aggregate types
- define the transformations on aggregates
  - don't implement yet, just define!

### Tooling
- Run dialyzer for internal consistency
- No unit tests, not implementing! If there's something that seems like it needs a unit test,
  that's a smell at this point. Just let all transformations be the identity.


## The Instance Server
- instantiate aggregates in processes
  - data are "aggregates in cryosleep"
- define the incoming messages
